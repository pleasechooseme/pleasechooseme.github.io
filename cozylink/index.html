              <p>CozyLink is a student startup aimed to tackle the fragmented, inefficient, and often unreliable rental process that many college students face with an all-in-one housing app.</p>
            </div>
            <p>As the founding designer, <strong>I designed the entire mobile app from 0-1</strong> including creating the logo, design system, and end-to-end flows over the course of two semesters. I collaborated with our founders and engineers on a weekly basis to present my work and align our vision for the app.</p>

                <p>
                  CozyLink is an all-in-one housing app that simplifies the rental process by providing students with full transparency on rental costs and availability. We connect students with other verified users, including previous tenants, interested tenants, and property listers, and offer roommate matching features to create a more trustworthy and streamlined housing experience.

          <p>
            College students are enthusiastic to live off-campus as a way to gain greater independence. However, they are currently <strong>frustrated by the disjointed methods of searching for rentals</strong> and communicating with all parties involved.

              <p>Lessors struggle to find suitable tenants while renters struggle to find detailed information about landlords and rentals, often resulting in not being able to sublet or compromising prices to find people.</p>

            <p>To supplement my primary research, I analyzed 6 mobile apps and 1 website before starting initial concepts.

            <p>Overall, users want more <strong>transparency on rentals</strong>, such as additional fees outside of the total rent and the ability to <strong>verify the landlord or lister</strong> of each property. Users are also looking for easier ways to ensure <strong>compatibility</strong> and connect with prospective roommates. Finally, they want to <strong>maximize in-app communication</strong> to avoid using multiple apps.</p>

                From our discussions, we initially tailored the app for students looking for housing and planning to sublease. As a result, I combined both search and listing features into one comprehensive homepage, including rental search, roommates, subleasing, and subletting.

                After team review, I realized I had misunderstood the roommate board as being for users with secured rentals, rather than those forming housing groups. Navigation was unclear, and there was no easy way to access the roommate questionnaire or rental posting form. I also noticed overlap between the roommates and landing pages, and confusion around the distinction between subleasing and subletting.

                I refined the design by adding more context to the title sections and creating a toggle for "Rental" and "Lister Details" on the rental details page. I also introduced features like an interactive map, an amenities list, and a Q&A board.

                To address the need for transparency, I moved roommate profiles to the lister details section and added landlord and tenant information. Finally, I updated the fixed footer to include quick actions for requesting a roommate or scheduling a tour.

            Was dedicating an entire navigation item for creating roommate profiles or rental posts necessary, given that students typically use these features only once? Additionally, the footer on the rental details page, with options like "Request Roommate" and "Arrange Tour," created confusion by merging student-specific and lister-specific features.

          <h2>⚠️ Overcoming a Roadblock: Redesigning for Diverse User Needs</h2>
          <p>Our team's goal was to combine listing and renting functionalities into a single account, and I designed with this approach in mind. However, this solution didn’t effectively address the diverse needs of our users. While my iterations met the needs of renters, they struggled to serve all user types—renter, sublessor, and landlord—due to the challenges of consolidating multiple functionalities into one account.</p>

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Don't strive for perfection</strong>: My younger self would have never thought I'd say this. However, our strive for perfection severely hindered our progress. We aimed to create a flawless product rather than focusing on a MVP and allowing user testing to guide the rest of the product. We should have prioritized key features and planned releases more effectively instead of trying to launch everything at once.</li>
              <li><strong>Focus on the overall experience</strong>: I spent an excessive amount of time on minor design aesthetics rather than on the overall user experience. This led to missing important edge cases and interaction details during prototyping. It’s crucial to balance visual design with usability to ensure a comprehensive and functional user experience.</li>
              <li><strong>Align on goals early</strong>: We often found ourselves misaligned on goals and lacked a comprehensive brainstorming session at the beginning of the project. Holding such a session would have helped us clarify objectives and set a unified direction. I would advocate for early goal alignment and collaborative planning in future projects.</li>
              <li><strong>Invest in discovery and definition</strong>: I would allocate more time to the discovery and definition phases of a project. This includes interviewing both renters and landlords, developing detailed user flows, and creating wireframes before moving on to mid to high-fidelity designs. Thorough exploration and definition of user needs and workflows are essential for creating a well-rounded and effective design.</li>
